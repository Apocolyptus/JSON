#Why does JSON matter?#

With the rise of AJAX-powered sites, it’s becoming more and more important for sites to be able to load data quickly and
asynchronously, or in the background without delaying page rendering. Switching up the contents of a certain element within our
layouts without requiring a page refresh adds a “wow” factor to our applications, not to mention the added convenience for our
users. Because of the popularity and ease of social media, many sites rely on the content provided by sites such as Twitter,
Flickr, and others. These sites provide RSS feeds, which are easy to import and use on the server-side, but if we try to load
them with AJAX, we run into a wall: we can only load an RSS feed if we’re requesting it from the same domain it’s hosted on.

JSON allows us to overcome the cross-domain issue because we can use a method called JSONP that uses a callback function to send
the JSON data back to our domain. It’s this capability that makes JSON so incredibly useful, as it opens up a lot of doors that
were previously difficult to work around.
