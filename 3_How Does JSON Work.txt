#How does JSON work?#

One of the easiest ways to load JSON data into our web applications is to use the $.ajax() method available in the jQuery
library.

• Number: a signed decimal number that may contain a fractional part and may use exponential E notation. JSON does not allow 
non-numbers like NaN, nor does it make any distinction between integer and floating-point
• String: a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters. Strings are delimited with double-quotation marks and support a
backslash escaping syntax
• Boolean: either of the values true or false
• Array: an ordered list of zero or more values, each of which may be of any type. Arrays use square bracket notation with
elements being comma-separated
• Object: an unordered collection of name/value pairs where the names (also called keys) are strings
• null: An empty value, using the word null

JSON generally ignores any whitespace around or between syntactic elements (values and punctuation, but not within a string
value). However JSON recognizes only four specific whitespace characters: the space, horizontal tab, line feed, and carriage
return. JSON does not provide or allow any sort of comment syntax.

Since JSON was derived from JavaScript and its syntax is (mostly) a subset of the language, it is often possible to use the
JavaScript eval() function to parse JSON data. This is considered unsafe. Instead, a JSON parser library or JavaScript's native
JSON support should be used for reading and writing JSON. A correctly implemented JSON parser will only accept valid JSON,
preventing potentially malicious code from being inadvertently executed.
